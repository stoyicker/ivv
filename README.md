# Architecture
This app is split follows a 'feature' split, with three features:
* 'splash', for the splash screen.
* 'list', for the item list.
* 'detail', for the item detail.

# Language choice
I chose Kotlin over Java because:
* It is less verbose than Java.
* It is more natural both to read and write, and is easy to approach for Java developers as well.
* It can be configured to generate up to Java 6 bytecode, which means its evolution is independent of that of the platform.
* It is [officially supported by Google as a first-class language for Android](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/05/kotlin-on-android-now-official/).

# Documentation
Documentation is generated using [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka), which is the
code documentation generation tool for Kotlin, similar to what Javadoc is for Java.
`index.html` for the documentation of each module can be found in their `build` directories:
 `module_name/build/dokka/module_name/index.html`.

# Tests
 Different tests are written using JUnit. Run them with the `test` Gradle task in each module.
 Instrumented tests are only present in the `splash` module and can be run using the `cAT` task.

# Setup for contributions
Once cloned, just setup the hooks:

```shell
$<project-dir>: ./hooks/setup (or equivalent if on Windows).
```

# Potential improvements
* Running instrumented and monkey tests on CI. Also some parallelism can probably be introduced to 
speed things up.
* Refining infrastructure; there's a fair amount of duplication as things are now. Also maybe drop 
Groovy for Kotlin.
* Some more tests never hurt.
* Some assets only include mdpi densities, which will cause crashes in devices in lower resolution 
screen buckets and memory overhead to upscale the resource in device in higher resolution buckets 
(plus, in some cases, visual artifacts).
* Some other TODOs left around.
